# TurnoPlus Project Context

## Current Development Status

TurnoPlus is currently in active development with a solid foundation established for both backend and frontend components. The project has progressed through initial setup and is now in the feature implementation phase.

## Recently Completed Work

### Backend Implementation
- **Core Architecture**: FastAPI application with hexagonal architecture pattern
- **Database Models**: Complete SQLAlchemy models for User, Patient, Doctor, Admin, Appointment, MedicalRecord, Office, and Availability entities
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based multi-role authentication with role-based access control
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for all major entities (users, patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, offices, system settings)
- **Database Migration**: Alembic configuration with initial schema migrations
- **Security Implementation**: Password hashing with salt, JWT token generation and validation
- **DateTime Validation Fix**: Fixed critical appointment booking issue with proper timezone handling and validation

### Frontend Implementation
- **Angular Application**: Angular 20.3.0+ application with TypeScript
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete login/register system with role-based routing
- **UI Framework**: Angular Material components for consistent design
- **Module Structure**: Feature-based modules with lazy loading for patient, doctor, and admin interfaces
- **Core Services**: Authentication service, HTTP interceptors, and route guards
- **Responsive Design**: SCSS styling with responsive design principles

## Current Work Focus

### Recently Resolved Issues
1. **Appointment Booking System**: Fixed critical datetime validation issues that were preventing patients from booking appointments:
   - **Root Cause**: Start time was after end time due to timezone conversion problems
   - **Solution**: Added proper datetime validation and timezone-aware handling
   - **Impact**: Patients can now successfully book appointments without 422 errors

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error messages and logging for better debugging:
   - Added specific validation for datetime ranges (start < end, future appointments)
   - Better error messages for availability conflicts
   - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### In Progress
1. **Doctor Dashboard**: Implementing doctor-specific features including:
   - Availability calendar with recurring patterns
   - Patient appointment management
   - Medical record creation and editing
   - Consultation history tracking

2. **Admin Panel**: Developing administrative tools for:
   - User management across all roles
   - Office/facility configuration
   - System settings management
   - Analytics and reporting

### Recently Implemented
1. **Patient Module**: Complete patient-facing functionality including:
   - Profile management
   - Appointment booking interface (now working correctly)
   - Medical records access
   - Appointment history and management

2. **Authentication System**: Full authentication flow with:
   - Multi-role login (patient, doctor, admin)
   - Token-based session management
   - Route protection with guards
   - Automatic token injection

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Complete Doctor Dashboard**
   - Availability management with recurring patterns
   - Patient appointment scheduling interface
   - Medical record templates and editing tools

2. **Implement Admin Panel**
   - User approval workflows
   - Office management interface
   - System configuration tools

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Appointment blocking system
   - Advanced filtering and search
   - Notification system for appointments

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Unit tests for backend services (partially complete - appointment booking tested)
   - Frontend component testing
   - Integration testing for API endpoints
   - End-to-end testing scenarios

## Technical Debt and Improvements Needed

1. **Error Handling**: ✅ Improved comprehensive error handling for appointment booking
2. **Validation**: ✅ Enhanced datetime validation and sanitization
3. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and frontend loading times
4. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
5. **Security**: Implement additional security measures (rate limiting, CSRF protection)

## Known Issues and Resolutions

### Fixed Issues
- **Appointment Booking 422 Errors**:
  - **Problem**: Patients couldn't book appointments due to datetime validation failures
  - **Root Cause**: Start time > end time due to timezone conversion issues
  - **Resolution**: Added `_validate_datetime_range()` method with proper timezone handling
  - **Files Modified**: `backend/src/app/services/appointments.py`, `backend/src/app/controllers/appointments.py`, `backend/src/app/routes/v1/doctors.py`

## Current Database Schema

The database schema includes the following core entities:
- **Users**: Base authentication entity with role assignment
- **Patients**: Extended user profiles with medical information
- **Doctors**: Professional profiles with specialties and office assignments
- **Admins**: Administrative user profiles
- **Appointments**: Scheduled appointments with status tracking
- **Medical Records**: Patient medical history and consultation notes
- **Offices**: Healthcare facility locations
- **Availability**: Doctor availability schedules with recurring patterns
- **Appointment Blocks**: Time blocks for appointment scheduling

## Current API Structure

The API follows RESTful conventions with the following endpoint groups:
- `/api/v1/users` - User management and authentication
- `/api/v1/patients` - Patient-specific operations
- `/api/v1/doctors` - Doctor-specific operations
- `/api/v1/admins` - Administrative operations
- `/api/v1/appointments` - Appointment scheduling and management
- `/api/v1/medical-records` - Medical record operations
- `/api/v1/offices` - Office management
- `/api/v1/settings` - System configuration

## Development Environment Setup

### Backend
- Python 3.13+ with uv package manager
- MySQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- FastAPI development server with auto-reload
- Alembic for database migrations

### Frontend
- Angular CLI with TypeScript
- Angular Material for UI components
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Karma and Jasmine for testing

## Deployment Considerations

The application is designed for deployment with:
- Backend: Containerized FastAPI application
- Frontend: Static files served by web server or CDN
- Database: MySQL with connection pooling
- Environment-specific configuration management
