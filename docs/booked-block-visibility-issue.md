# Booked Block Visibility Issue Analysis

## Problem Description

After a patient successfully books an appointment (e.g., Sunday November 2nd from 11 AM to 12 PM), the time slot still appears as available in the patient booking interface when the page is refreshed or checked again.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Backend Logic Flow

The appointment booking process in [`backend/src/app/services/appointments.py`](backend/src/app/services/appointments.py:94-146) follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: Validates datetime range, patient/doctor existence, and slot availability
2. **Appointment Creation**: Creates the appointment record
3. **Block Marking**: Attempts to mark the corresponding block as booked:
   ```python
   block = self._session.scalars(
       select(AppointmentBlockModel)
       .where(AppointmentBlockModel.availability_id == availability.id)
       .where(AppointmentBlockModel.start_at == data.start_at)
       .where(AppointmentBlockModel.end_at == data.end_at)
       .where(AppointmentBlockModel.is_booked == False)
   ).first()
   
   if block:
       block.is_booked = True
       logger.info(f"Marked block {block.id} as booked")
   else:
       logger.warning(f"No matching block found for appointment {appointment.id}")
   ```

### 2. Potential Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Transaction Commit Timing
The code uses `self._session.flush()` but may not be committing the transaction properly, especially if there's an exception or rollback later in the process.

#### Issue 2: Block Matching Logic
The block matching logic requires exact datetime matching. If there are any timezone conversion issues or microsecond differences, the block won't be found and marked as booked.

#### Issue 3: Missing Relationship
The appointment model has a `block_id` field but it's not being set when creating the appointment, which could lead to data inconsistency.

### 3. Frontend Refresh Logic

In [`frontend/src/app/patient/components/patient-booking.component.ts`](frontend/src/app/patient/components/patient-booking.component.ts:101-102), after successful booking:

```typescript
this.booked.emit(appointment);
this.loadAvailability(doctor.id);
this.loadAvailableBlocks(doctor.id);
```

The frontend correctly refreshes both availability and available blocks, but if the backend didn't properly mark the block as booked, it will still appear in the available blocks list.

### 4. API Endpoint Analysis

The [`list_available_blocks()`](backend/src/app/services/appointments.py:78-91) method correctly filters for unbooked blocks:

```python
.where(AppointmentBlockModel.is_booked == False)
```

However, if the block wasn't marked as booked due to the issues above, it will still appear in the results.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Fix Backend Transaction Management

Ensure proper transaction commit and error handling in the booking process.

### 2. Improve Block Matching Logic

Add more robust block matching that handles timezone differences and provides better logging.

### 3. Set Appointment-Block Relationship

Properly link the appointment to its corresponding block.

### 4. Add Comprehensive Testing

Create tests to verify the complete booking flow and ensure booked blocks don't appear in available blocks.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Backend Fixes**:
   - Fix transaction management in `AppointmentsService.book()`
   - Improve block matching logic with better error handling
   - Set appointment-block relationship
   - Add comprehensive logging

2. **Frontend Improvements**:
   - Add error handling for booking failures
   - Improve user feedback when booking succeeds

3. **Testing**:
   - Create end-to-end test for booking flow
   - Test specific case mentioned (Sunday Nov 2nd, 11 AM - 12 PM)
   - Verify block visibility after booking

## Files to Modify

### Backend
- `backend/src/app/services/appointments.py` - Fix booking logic
- `backend/src/app/controllers/appointments.py` - Improve error handling
- `backend/src/app/routes/v1/doctors.py` - Add logging for available blocks endpoint

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/app/patient/components/patient-booking.component.ts` - Improve error handling
- `frontend/src/app/core/services/appointments.service.ts` - Add better error handling

### Tests
- Create new test file to reproduce and verify the fix
- Update existing tests to cover this scenario

## Success Criteria

1. After booking an appointment, the time slot no longer appears in available blocks
2. The appointment is properly linked to its corresponding block
3. Frontend correctly reflects the updated availability
4. No data inconsistencies between appointments and blocks
5. Robust error handling prevents partial bookings
